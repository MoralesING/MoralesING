 Hi, I'm Morales 
 A young technology enthusiast, taking my first steps into the world of programming. Excited to learn new skills and overcome challenges, I have decided to start documenting 
 my progress and projects on GitHub. Here, I will share my progress, from small scripts to more complex applications, as I dive into various programming languages and 
 development tools. This is just the beginning of my journey to becoming a developer!

 > !Coming Soon! "Personal Website Project"
